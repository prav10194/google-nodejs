Setting up the Node.js application
-------

1. Clone/Download zip of repository.

2. Extract content of the zip.

3. Open cmd to run the following code -
```cmd
cd "folderpath where zip is extracted"
npm install
```

4. After the installation, run -  
```cmd
npm start
```

Setting up the .env file
-------

1. You need to register for google geoencoder api from here - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key?authuser=1

Copy the API KEY in the .env file.

2. You also need to have a bluemix account and should have credentials for the Weather API. You can get it from here - https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/weather-company-data

Copy the Username and Password of the SERVICE (as shown in image) in the .env file.

Setting up the ngrok
-------

1. In Google Actions, you need an endpoint so that it can connect to your app locally. For this we will install ngrok. Download from here - https://ngrok.com/download

2. Run your app using npm start as explained above in Setting up the Node.js application.

3. Open another terminal and run the following command -

```cmd
ngrok http 8080
```
8080 is the port number on which your Nodejs app is running.

4. Copy the Forwarding domain from the ngrok terminal. E.g. Your domain would look something like - https://c90db8b2.ngrok.io

Paste it in the Amazon Alexa Endpoint Configuration.

The final endpoint will be - https://c90db8b2.ngrok.io/weather
